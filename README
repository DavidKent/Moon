Fairly basic implementation, I made this because most other static-file-servers for Nodejs are way overbloated, i.e. updating
every time a change is made. This is uneccesary unless you are dealing with a CMS or are going to be constantly changing html
inside of documents. You must have some knowledge of nodejs to implement this, since I didn't really put much effort into packaging
it.

usage:

function walk = require('walk');
function moon = require('./moon.js');

/*
moon.js will read from client/static folder by default, my setup is
    PROJECT_FOLDER
        client
            static
                [files]
        server
            utils
                [moon]
            node.exe
        run.cmd
*/

var requestFromClient = function(request, result) {
    result.end(moon.getPage('/register.html').toString());    
}
